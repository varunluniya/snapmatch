"""
Guardrail layer -- post-model output validation.

Retrieval and context cut the odds of a wrong answer, but nothing about them
stops a fluent, well-cited-sounding response from still contradicting or
misapplying the very policy passages it was grounded in. This is exactly the
layer the Air Canada chatbot was missing (Guide 4, Section 6): it retrieved
nothing and had no check before answering, so a confident, wrong answer
reached the customer and the tribunal held the airline liable for it.

`guardrail_check` runs *after* the model answers and *before* the answer
reaches anyone, using the same retrieved passages as the yardstick -- the
guide's own Section 7.3 pattern:

    is_safe, reason = guardrail_check(response, passages, llm, offline=...)
    return response if is_safe else fallback_message(reason)

`offline` is a repo-specific, rule-based stand-in for the live model call
(same honest-disclosure pattern as every other LLM call in this codebase --
see gen4/llm.py). It gets the response text and the retrieved passages and
returns (is_safe, reason); it is what actually runs in this environment
since no external LLM API key is configured, and it is also what runs if a
live call ever fails or returns something unusable.
